## What does this change?

<!-- A PR should have enough detail to be understandable far in the future. e.g what is the problem/why is the change needed, how does it solve it and any questions or points of discussion. -->

## How to test

<!-- Provide instructions to help others verify the change. This could take the form of "On PROD, do X and witness Y. On this branch, do X and witness Z. " -->

## How can we measure success?

<!-- Do you expect errors to decrease? Do you expect user journeys to be simplified? What can be used to prove this? A filtered view of logs or analytics, etc? -->

## Have we considered potential risks?

<!-- What are the potential risks and how can they be mitigated? Does an error require an alarm? -->
